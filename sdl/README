This folder contains C SDL2 test programs contained within single source files. They are highly commented and are meant to teach the basics of SDL.

These include: 
	Initializing SDL
	Creating windows
	Handling user input
	Rendering rectangles
	Loading and rendering images with SDL_image
	Playing sound effects with SDL_mixer
	Playing music with SDL_mixer

To get the most out of these tutorials, it's best that you read through the source files in the chronological order, which is:
	init.c           - Initializing SDL
	window.c         - Creating a window
	event.c          - Handling SDL events
	render_clear.c   - Using SDL's renderer to clear the screen
	rectangles.c     - Rendering rectangles
	png.c            - Loading a PNG image with SDL_image and rendering it

Whenever you see a new SDL function being used, make sure you read up about it on the SDL wiki:
	For SDL:         https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/CategoryAPI
	For SDL_image:   https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_image/CategoryAPI
	For SDL_mixer:   https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_mixer/CategoryAPI
