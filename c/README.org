Here is an overview of the =c= directory. It contains C source files with sample code and Org documents for explaining various C topics. You should know [[../unix/shell.org][the basics of the UNIX command line]] before reading them.

If you are just starting to learn C, this is the order you should read these documents in:

+ [[./hello.org]] :: Hello world tutorial
+ [[./variables.org]] :: Variables
+ [[./output.org]] :: Basic input & output
+ (topics I've yet to write about go here)
+ [[./struct.c]] :: Structures
+ [[./compilation.org]] :: The C compilation process

These documents can be read out of order:

+ [[./binhex.org]] :: Binary and hexidecimal numbering and literals
+ [[./bit_fields.c]] :: Bit fields
+ [[./inline_functions.c]] :: Inline functions

Here are descriptions of the directories here:

+ non-static-inline :: A demonstration of using non-static inline functions
